#PURPOSE
- Refactor applications from GA into PWAs to create a better mobile experience for hiring managers/recruiters.
- Revisit old code to refactor into something better/faster than what was originally written.
- Finish up any application that was not able to be completed in the 1 week timeframe at GA

#APPS TO REFACTOR:
- Curious (also refactoring into React Native)
- BCJP app (looking to refactoring into React Native/AWS)
- Eat Drink Den

#TO THE READER: 
Each application will be it's own folder, including the tutorial that spawned my interest into mobile development
